1. **LS** - ls command is used to know what files are in the directory you are in. You can see all the hidden files by using the command ls -a
  ```sh
  ls
  ls -a
  ```
2. **MKDIR** - mkdir command is used when you need to create a folder or a directory
  ```sh
  mkdir <directory_name>
  ```
3. **RMDIR** -  rmdir can only be used to delete an empty directory
  ```sh
  rmdir <directory_name>
  ```
4. **TOUCH** - The touch command is used to create a file. It can be anything, from an empty txt file to an empty zip file.
  ```sh
  touch <filename>
  ```
5. **RM** - To delete a directory containing files, use rm.
  ```sh
  rm <filename> 
  ```
6. **CP** - Use the cp command to copy files through the command line. It takes two arguments: The first is the location of the file to be copied, the second is where to copy.
  ```sh
  cp <filename>
  ```
7. **MV** - Use the mv command to move files through the command line. We can also use the mv command to rename a file.
  ```sh
  mv <filename> <location>
  mv <old filename> <new filename>
  ```
8. **DU** - If you want to know the disk usage for a particular folder or file in Linux, you can type in the command df and the name of the folder or file
  ```sh
  du <folder name> 
  ```
9. **ECHO** - The "echo" command helps us move some data, usually text into a file.
  ```sh
  echo <data> >> <filename>
  ```
10. **DF** - Use the df command to see the available disk space in each of the partitions in your system. You can just type in df in the command line and you can see each mounted partition 
  ```sh
  df -m
  ```
